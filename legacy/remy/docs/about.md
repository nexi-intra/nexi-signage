Based on resources in Microsoft Office 365 (Exchange Online) REMY provides support for automated visitor registration, server side logic for handling changes to resources booking as well as providing "kiosk" interfaces for adding metadata to visitors, path finding and resource status incl. ad hoc booking on the spot.

The solution basically fills the gap between what Microsoft deliver out of the box in Outlook (desktop, web & mobile), in MS Teams and/or other connected apps.

Microsoft do not support visitor registrations, kiosk mode displays and catering. Also Microsoft haven't got Enterprise grade administrative features providing what is need for the staff in facility management for administrating
